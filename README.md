# Flight Management Program
The objective of this project was to gain experience in applying the principles of C++ programming and some of its fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) (encapsulation, abstraction) in an application that is relatively close to a real world example but at a much smaller scale. This application is a C++ command-line application. Specifically this is a Flight Management Program, with an Object Oriented design, it uses C++ File I/O to read and write Flight and Passenger data from and to a .txt file, and it is operated via the command-line.
